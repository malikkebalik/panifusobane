He’s wearing a green outfit and colorful Louis Vuitton sneakers, a bit overdressed for a place that has a towering Transformers statue of “Bumblebee” in the lobby.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>At one point, a little boy walks up to Moore.</p><p>“Are you rich?” the youngster asks.</p><p>“I do OK,” the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Colts</a> cornerback responds, laughing as he leans down to become eye level.</p><p>The boy had begun to piece things together. Moments earlier, Moore announced that through a partnership with Ashley HomeStore, the 50 local foster kids in attendance would receive brand new beds, including a twin mattress set, sheets and comforter.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/02200925/DSC_0830.jpg alt width=1620 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1620px) 100vw, 1620px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Kenny Moore II’s Louis Vuitton shoes got the attention of his new friends at The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis. (James Boyd / The Athletic)</span><p>They’d also get a chance to play outside with Moore on the mini basketball court and football field at the museum’s complex. A few minutes after scarfing down their food, that little boy and other children began tugging on Moore’s clothes, pulling him down the hall toward the fun.</p><p>This was Moore’s third time backing the foster care event, but this one felt different. This one — on the eve of the 2023 NFL Draft, just over 24 hours before Anthony Richardson would become the new face of the Colts’ franchise — had a real chance of never happening. At least not with him.</p><p>“It’s a blessing to give back here in the Indianapolis community,” Moore said. “Obviously, I was gonna be back either way because I had a year left on my contract.”</p><p>That part wasn’t obvious, though. In fact, it was the opposite. Three months earlier, the look on Moore’s face was that of a dejected, frustrated and lost player. A Pro Bowler in 2021, Moore was not utilized the same way at nickelback during Gus Bradley’s first year as the Colts’ defensive coordinator in 2022. The 27-year-old failed to snag an interception throughout an entire season for the first time in his career, which was compounded by an ankle injury that sidelined him for the final five games.</p><p>Moore aired his grievances in January as the Colts cleaned out their lockers at West 56th Street, some of whom, like <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Parris Campbell</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bobby Okereke</a> (both now with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Giants</a>), for the last time. It wouldn’t have been a surprise if that had been Moore’s last time, too.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Coaching and playing works together,” Moore said that day. “We just didn’t click. We didn’t click. I wasn’t able to give them exactly what they wanted, first and foremost. I didn’t give myself what I wanted.”</p><p>After being reminded of his comments, Moore conceded that there was a period of uncertainty this offseason. With one year left on his deal, Indianapolis could’ve traded or cut him and created $8.2 million in cap space with no dead cap hit in 2023.</p><p>“I think anything was possible as far as me being on the team or not on the team,” Moore said, his voice trailing off. “Or on somebody else’s team.”</p><p>“It could’ve been likely to happen. I don’t really know,” he continued. “But I don’t handle those keys. It’s just good to be back.”</p><p>Colts general manager Chris Ballard said at the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> owners’ meetings in March that he received trade calls about Moore, but <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Stephon Gilmore</a> turned out to be the cornerback who was moved. The former Defensive Player of the Year was shipped to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cowboys</a> in March after requesting a trade, leaving Moore as the only multiyear starting cornerback on the Colts’ roster. That development solidified Moore’s opportunity to bounce back in Indy while mentoring an influx of young talent.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Colts post-draft depth chart: How Anthony Richardson, new picks fit in Indy</p></a><p>The Colts selected big-bodied cornerbacks Julius Brents, Darius Rush and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylon Jones</a> in the second, fifth and seventh rounds, respectively. Brents, an Indianapolis native and former Warren Central High School star, has the potential to be a Day 1 starter alongside Moore. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Isaiah Rodgers Sr.</a> is poised to be the third starter as he enters his fourth season, while second-year player <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dallis Flowers</a> will vie for snaps with Rush and Jones.</p><p>“I’ll be a leader and have a voice, but we all walk side by side,” Moore said. “I’m not gonna be in front of them screaming at them and telling them to do whatever or giving them all the keys in the world. If they need help, I’ll give them help. If I need help, they’ll give me help. We’re all going to be connected.”</p><p>Moore, who went undrafted in 2017, plans to set the tone for his unit while building on his improbable career. He has 14 interceptions, 49 passes defended, four forced fumbles and eight sacks through his first six seasons, all in Indy.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Bradley said Moore was “right” to be upset after seeing a dip in production in 2022. Another year together will help Moore get back to his old ways, Bradley suggested, and defensive backs coach Ron Milus echoed Bradley’s sentiments.</p><p>“He knows exactly what we’re looking for at this point in the offseason, and I just think his growth is gonna be there,” Milus said. “He’ll be able to make the kind of plays he’s accustomed to making.”</p><p>Exactly how Moore will be featured in the Colts’ defense this season remains to be seen. Milus, Bradley and Moore didn’t tip their hands, but after Moore “tapped the reset button” following a 4-12-1 campaign, he said he’s been in constant contact with his coaches about how to improve individually and collectively.</p><p>Moore added that new Colts head coach Shane Steichen, known for his offensive prowess, has reinvigorated all three phases of the team. Richardson provided a big boost as well, ending Indianapolis’ four-year QB merry-go-round after Andrew Luck’s retirement in 2019. The 20-year-old signal caller and Steichen will share most of the spotlight in 2023, though Moore has no plans of being in the shadows.</p><p>He already knows what that feels like, having clawed his way up from a Division II program to the Pro Bowl. Moore bet on himself, and as he enters the final season of a four-year, $33.3-million contract, he’ll bet on himself again.</p><p>“I can’t say enough how blessed I am to still be here and to still be wearing No. 23. I just want to keep this going,” Moore said. “Obviously, last year was not easy at all, but that gives us another chance this year to make things right.”</p><p>(Top photo: Kenny Moore II at a foster care event at The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis: James Boyd / The Athletic)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k21va29oanxzfJFsZmltX2WAcK%2FOpausZZuau6%2FFjKamqKqVYrS2v4ybqZqcnJrGcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./frank-ocean-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Frank Ocean Net Worth</a>
