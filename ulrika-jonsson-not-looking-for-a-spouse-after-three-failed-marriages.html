after Three Failed Marriages</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Ulrika Jonsson was a part of Celebs Go Dating, a reality celebrity dating show recently. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But she did not participate in&nbsp;the show to find a new spouse or anyone special.</p><p>Finding a new man&nbsp;was never one of her motivations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In fact, she is fine on her own now and has given up on the idea of finding "the one."</p><h2>Ulrika Jonsson Is Done with Dating and Marriages</h2><p>As <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Jonsson admitted</a> to Kate Thornton on her White Wine Question Time podcast in November 2021, she was done looking for the right person.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That, however, did not mean she was entirely over the idea of marriage, though. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I still love the idea of marriage," Jonsson said. "but I'm not going to get married again."</p><p>She admitted to having looked for "the one" all her life, and she had now stopped doing so.</p><p>Earlier in 2021, she had made people believe that she was still open to the idea of marriage, saying, "While it would feel strange getting married again, I can't ever rule it out for the future." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, while talking to Thornton, she was confident she did not want to marry or have children again.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Nevertheless, she was still dating. In her 2022 column for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>, she said that she had&nbsp;"spent much of last year in the cesspit of dating apps and dating." However, she was&nbsp;now looking for the "best bits of a relationship" instead.</p><p>She also claimed that she had now become a "new breed of woman" who was not tied down by the traditional rules of society in terms of marriages. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her time as a <a href=# rel=follow>Celebs Go Dating contestant</a>&nbsp;wasn't enough to change her mind, either. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, her experience on the show gave her&nbsp;insights into her weaknesses and a stronger realization that she did not "need" a man.</p><h2>Ulrika Jonsson’s Three Failed Marriages</h2><p>Before Jonsson came to her conclusions about marriage, she had her fair share of failed relationships.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The TV presenter got married to her first spouse, cameraman John Turnbull, in 1990. In terms of children, they had one&nbsp;son, Cameron, in 1994.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But their marriage fell apart soon after, and Jonsson divorced her first spouse in 1995. One of the reasons for the split was her unfaithfulness.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Then, she dated footballer Stan Collymore before getting into a relationship with German hotel manager Marcus Kempen.</p><p>She and Kempen had their daughter, Bo, in 2000. This relationship, too, ended soon after Bo was born. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After this, in April 2002, she confirmed her relationship with former England Football Team manager Sven-Goran Eriksson and also revealed they had recently broken up at the time.</p><p>That same year, Jonsson met Lance Gerrard-Wright on the show, Mr. Right.</p><p>It was sort of fitting that she would meet her second spouse while hosting a dating show, and he would be a contestant on that same show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A year later, in August 2003, they would become husband and wife. Then, in 2004, they welcomed their daughter, Martha.</p><p>Their marriage could only last for about three years. Jonsson ended things with her second spouse in October 2006.</p><p>In March&nbsp;2008, Jonsson entered marriage with her third spouse, American advertising executive Brian Monet. This would turn out to be her longest marriage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They were married until April 2019, when the former couple revealed they had filed for divorce despite their best efforts to save the relationship, including counseling.</p><p>Talking about their children, they only had a single son, Malcolm, who was born the year they got married.</p><p><img alt="Ulrika Jonsson's children pose for a selfie." height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Ulrika-Jonsson-kids-with-spouse.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p><strong>Ulrika Jonsson's children&nbsp;— Cameron, Bo, Martha, and Malcolm&nbsp;—&nbsp;pose for a selfie.</strong> (Photo: Ulrika Jonsson/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Now, despite how it looks from the outside — three marriages and three divorces — Jonsson does not think her choices weren't good.</p><p>"I reflect that I chose my three husbands rather well," wrote Jonsson on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun column</a> on December 23, 2021.</p><p>For her, it isn't about how the marriage was when they were together, but how they ended things when it was time to go their separate ways.</p><p>She has kept a working relationship with all her former&nbsp;husbands for the sake of their children.</p><p>In her writing, she admitted that she still spent Christmas with her third husband when all her children&nbsp;were there.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During the festivities, she handled the kitchen, whereas Monet dealt with the decorations and kids.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK2cp7asrYyjpqero6S7br%2FPqKysnV2jvLh6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./where-is-omeretta-the-great-from-sorry-not-sorry-singer-boyfriend-tabyron-rashad-smith-and-more-the.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Is Omeretta The Great From?
