December 1951, in Rowayton, Connecticut USA, and is a Golden Globe Award-nominated actor, best known for his roles in such films and TV series as “Hair” (1979), “A Street Car Named Desire” (1984), and “Everwood” (2002-2006), among many other differing roles. Treat’s career started in the early 1970s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Treat Williams is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Treat`s net worth is as high as $4 million, earned through his successful career in the entertainment industry. Apart from appearing on screen, Treat also has a respectable career in theater, appearing in such plays as “Grease” (1972-1980), “Once in a Lifetime” (1978), “Love Letters” (1989-1990), and “Follies” (2001), which have also improved his wealth.</p><h3>Treat Williams Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Treat is the son of Richard Norman Williams and his wife Marian; he grew up in his hometown and went to Kent School. After matriculation Treat enrolled at Franklin and Marshall College, and graduated with a degree in arts in 1973.</p><p>Before his college education ended, Treat ventured into acting, securing the role of Danny Zuko in “Grease” in 1972, and playing the character in various theaters until 1980. He has continued to appear in theatre productions throughout his career.</p><p>His screen debut came in 1975 with a minor role in the film “Deadly Hero”, starring <a href=#>James Earl Jones</a> and Don Murray. The next year he featured in Richard Lester’s Oscar-nominated comedy “The Ritz” with Jack Weston, <a href=#>Rita Moreno</a> and <a href=#>Jerry Stiller</a> in lead roles. He spent the rest of the ‘70s building his name with roles in such productions as John Struges` “The Eagle Has Landed”, with <a href=#>Michael Caine</a>, <a href=#>Donald Sutherland</a> and <a href=#>Robert Duvall</a>, and the Golden Globe Award-nominated musical “Hair” (1979), directed by <a href=#>Milos Forman</a>, with John Savage, <a href=#>Beverly D’Angelo</a> and Treat in lead roles. His net worth was well established.</p><p>The next decade was extremely successful for Williams as he appeared in more than 15 film titles and recorded some of his most popular roles to the present day. He started with the lead role in the comedy drama “Why Would I Lie”, next to Lisa Eichhorn and <a href=#>Gabriel Macht</a>, and then starred in Sidney Lumet`s crime drama “Prince of the City” (1981), as Detective Daniel Ciello. The same year, Treat appeared as D.B. Cooper in the crime thriller “The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper”, and in 1983 portrayed the famous 1920’s boxer Jack Dempsey in the biographical drama “Dempsey” directed by Gus Trikonis. The following year he played James Conway O’Donnell in Sergio Leone`s Golden Globe Award-nominated drama “Once Upon a Time in America”, starring <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=#>James Woods</a> and <a href=#>Elizabeth McGovern</a>, and the same year appeared as Stanley Kowalski in Golden Globe- awarded drama “A Streetcar Named Desire”, with Ann Margaret. Three years later Treat played the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover in the film of the same title, and by the end of the ‘80s had featured in such titles as “Night of the Sharks” (1988), “Dead Heat” (1988), and “Heat of Dixie” (1989), among others, all of which added to his net worth.</p><p>The ‘90s weren’t as fruitful as the previous decade, however, thanks to his fame Treat secured several high-profile roles, including in such films and TV series as “Good Advice” (1993-1994) as Jack Harold, then the crime drama film directed by Gary Felder “Things to Do in Denver When You’re Dead” (1995), and the next year he portrayed Xander Drax in the action comedy “Phantom” starring <a href=#>Billy Zane</a>. He finished the decade with roles in two fairly successful films – “Deep Rising” (1998) and “The Deep End of the Ocean” (1999), which only increased further his net worth.</p><p>Treat started the new millennium with roles in less popular films, including “Crash Point Zero” (2001), only to bounce back with one of the lead roles in the TV series “Everwood” (2002-2006), with Gregory Smith and <a href=#>Emily VanCamp</a>, meantime in 2002 appearing in several films including “Guilty Hearts” and “Hollywood Ending”, among others. In 2007 he appeared in Tom McLoughlin`s “The Staircase Murders”, and then in 2010 featured in <a href=#>Danny Boyle</a>`s Oscar-nominated drama “127 Hours”, starring <a href=#>James Franco</a> and <a href=#>Kate Mara</a>. Since then his career has started to decline somewhat, and roles in films dwindled. In 2014 he appeared in “Barefoot”, starring <a href=#>Evan Rachel Wood</a>, <a href=#>Scott Speedman</a>, and <a href=#>J.K. Simmons</a>, and most recently he had the lead role in <a href=#>“The Congressman” (2016), </a>and TV series “Chesapeake Shores” (2016- present).</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Treat has been married to actress and producer Pam Van Sant since 1988; the couple has two children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.982744783307><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Treat Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 1, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Rowayton, Connecticut, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.77 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>144&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Franklin & Marshall College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Pam Van Sant (m. 1988-)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Gill Williams, Elinor Williams</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Richard Norman Williams, Marian Andrew Williams</td></tr><tr readability=0.2962962962963><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.k.simmons.92</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/rtreatwilliams?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001852/</a></td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best New Star of the Year/ Best Actor/ Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series b(1980, 82, 85), Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance (2004, 2003), Teen Choice Award, Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead, Satellite Award (2005), Primetime Emmy Aw...</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>“The Eagle Has Landed”, “Hair” (1979), “Prince of the City” (1981), “The Pursuit of D.B.

I realized seeing it 30 years later, as difficult as it is to see myself learning my craft on film... It really was an American tragedy, watching this guy try and find his way back from being corrupt. But you can't go back. You cannot undo it. And by trying to undo it and control it, he brought down the entire Special Investigations unit, and the New York Police Department changed. It's really an extraordinary job on Sidney [Lumet's] part. It's a great study in the human condition. It's a big film. It's big emotionally. It's operatic. It's a great, great film, I think. I wish I'd had more experience and been a little older when I did it, but it's the best I could do at the time, and I'm very proud of it.</td></tr><tr readability=21><td>2</td><td>(2011, on filming The Phantom) Fun! You can see my teeth marks all over the screen. I chewed it up. But I had a blast. I mean, I don't think the film quite works, but I love Simon Wincer, the director, and Billy Zane was a lot of fun. The thing that was fun about that was that I'm a fan of the '30s screwball comedies and '30s-style acting, which was that balls-to-the-wall, all-American acting. It reminds me of the guy who starred in the original King Kong, where everybody's, like, "Say! We're gonna do this! Hey, let's take this bar and turn it into a theater!" You know? I always thought that Xander Drax was kind of like Clark Gable on acid. So I had a lot of fun with that. Again, I was given a lot of leeway, and I just had a blast, saying stuff like, "The skulls of Touganda!" All that stuff was so much fun. If I'm not having fun, I don't really want to do it.</td></tr><tr readability=29><td>3</td><td>(2011, on filming Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) Probably one of the most iconic, interesting scripts. Scott [Rosenberg's] script, he created a new language that I just thought was amazing. And Gary Fleder, with whom I've remained very good friends, he's a wonderful director. Great guy. When I came in and said, "I think Critical Bill doesn't have a bathroom in the apartment, but he has to pee, so how about he pees in plastic bottles?" And someone said, "What if we have the plastic bottles lined up?" So everybody had these kind of weird, fun ideas, and then Andy [Garcia] started playing with the idea that the apartment smelled, so he's got the handkerchief through the whole scene. We just had a blast. It was a really fun, creative, open environment, and without Gary and Andy, I don't think Critical Bill would've come to life. But it really was one of my most fun roles. I'm really proud of that character. He was really fun to play. It's very difficult to make it work when someone's that far out on the edge of reality, but I think as a team we kind of pulled it off. And, I mean, look, you've got Andy, Christopher Walken, Jack Warden. Oh, man, Jack Warden. Who gets to work with Jack Warden? That was so cool. To have Jack Warden actually describing your character to the audience? That's one of the greatest honors I've ever had in film.</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>4</td><td>(2011, on filming Hair) Probably the greatest film experience of my life. You know, throw on a pair of jeans and a vest and walk out of my apartment, walk into Central Park, and start shooting. It was so cool. I mean, a lot of prep, a lot of hard work on the singing and the dancing and all, but once we had that down, we started working in the park, and it was just really, really fun. I loved John Savage and Beverly D'Angelo, and Milos Forman is one of the great filmmakers of all time. That was really an honor to be a part of.</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>5</td><td>(2011, on filming Deep Rising) Fun. Just fun. I loved that movie. Just six months of freezing cold water up in Vancouver, Canada. But a great cast, some of whom have become very big movie stars since then, and a wonderful director with a great mind, Stephen Sommers. Just a really terrific, great guy. Probably the most energetic director I've ever come across. I'm proud of that film! I think that film's fun. Unfortunately, it came out right on the heels of Titanic.
