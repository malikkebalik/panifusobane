He is best known for his radio show, “Savage Nation,” and his series of books promoting “conservative nationalism.”</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Michael Savage, originally named Michael Alan Weiner, was born in The Bronx, New York on March 31, 1942. His parents, Benjamin and Rae Weiner, were Jewish emigrants from Russia. Savage had a difficult childhood with a critical father and a younger brother who was unable to hear or speak and eventually passed away. He graduated from Jamaica High School in 1958 and later earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from Queens College in 1963.</p><p>After college, Savage taught high school in New York City and also worked for Timothy Leary, a prominent advocate for psychedelic drugs, as a gatekeeper on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate. Savage was hired for the position because he did not use LSD. He later went on to earn a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine from the University of California, Berkeley, as well as master’s degrees in medical botany and medical anthropology from the University of Hawaii.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Savages_Career_as_a_Radio_Host>Michael Savage’s Career as a Radio Host</span></h2><p>Michael Savage’s career as a radio talk show host began in 1994 when his manuscript about illegal immigration was rejected by publishers. He recorded a demo tape and sent it to 250 radio stations across the country. He began his radio career in San Francisco’s KGO as a fill-in host and later debuted as the host of the afternoon drive time show, The Savage Nation. The show quickly became a hit and was syndicated nationally. By 2009, the show was being played on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened to radio talk show in the nation.</p><p>In September 2009, Savage’s home market of San Francisco announced it was dropping his program, leading to a lawsuit and the cancellation of the show. The show was later revived on Cumulus Media Networks and Savage was widely credited with helping Donald Trump become the President of the United States. In January 2019, Savage Nation was cut to two hours, and in September 2020, Savage announced that the radio show would be withdrawn from syndication at the end of the year, leaving only the podcast.</p><p>At the peak of “Savage Nation,” his show had an audience of nearly 10 million per day and was broadcast on 400 radio stations in the United States. Savage has written 40 books, including two #1 New York Times bestsellers. In March of 2017, Savage released what he professed would be his last book in the political sphere: Trump’s War: His Battle For America.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Savages_Political_Views>Michael Savage’s Political Views</span></h2><p>Michael Savage identifies as a conservative nationalist and believes in the importance of borders, language, and culture. He supports the English-only movement and is against illegal immigration to the United States. Savage also asserts that progressivism and liberalism are causing harm to American culture.</p><h2><span id=Controversies_Surrounding_Michael_Savage>Controversies Surrounding Michael Savage</span></h2><p>In 2009, Michael Savage was banned from entering the United Kingdom. He further stirred controversy in 2014 by calling sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder “weak” and drawing parallels between their condition and the Obama administration. Additionally, Savage opposes wearing masks in public to slow the spread of COVID-19, even in indoor and outdoor settings. The Southern Poverty Law Center has accused Savage of subscribing to the white genocide conspiracy theory, a white national belief. Savage has also faced criticism from LGBT groups for his insulting statements.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Savages_Personal_Life_and_Real_Estate_Holdings>Michael Savage’s Personal Life and Real Estate Holdings</span></h2><p>Michael Savage’s first marriage to Carol Ely ended in divorce in 1964. He remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet, with whom he has two children.</p><p>Interestingly, Michael’s son Russ Weiner is the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, and Janet was the company’s earliest investor and served as the company’s CFO. When Pepsi acquired Rockstar for $3.85 billion in March 2020, Russ was left with a net worth of $4 billion while Janet was left with a net worth of at least $200 million.</p><p>Michael owns several mansions around the country, including at least three properties in the Bay Area (two in Marin County and a condo in San Francisco), a home in Palm Beach, Florida, and a home in Beverly Hills, California.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC5yJyfmp2cYsCiwsCgnGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pedro-aquino-sanchez.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pedro Aquino Sanchez</a>
