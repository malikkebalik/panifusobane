The ex-couple, who got married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, are proud parents to their two children, Chase Ty Kapler and Dane Rio Kapler.</strong></p><p>As much as Gabe Kapler’s professional or career profile has received wide recognition, his personal life and family have also been of interest to the media. This includes the controversies that surround his fourteen-year marriage with his ex-wife, Lisa Jansen. Be that as it may, there is also a keen interest on the part of the public in knowing about their children. Read on as we have extensively revealed all there is to know about Gabe’s marriage to Lisa Jansen and their children.</p><h2><strong>Gabe Kapler’s Ex-Wife, Lisa Jansen Kapler Was His High School Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Gabe Kapler and his ex-wife both love to keep their personal lives away from the media, so little is known about their relationship. According to some sources, they started their love lives way back in high school, and no one expected it would go beyond just being school friends that care for each other. However, they held fast to their love for each other even long after high school.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Lisa-Jansen-Kapler-and-Gabe-Kapler.jpg alt="Lisa Kapler" width=696 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the report by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TheNetline</a>, they dated for over seven years before getting married, which means they started dating in 1992. It was further reported that Gabe Kapler and Lisa Jansen finally got married in 1999, but nothing is known about how their wedding went, being that they successfully kept it away from the media.</p><p>They lived together for some years, achieving great feats and welcoming two children. They both established the Gabe Kapler Foundation to stand up for victims of relationship abuse, owing to the fact that Lisa was once a victim.</p><h3><strong>They Ended their Marriage in 2013</strong></h3><p>Lisa Jansen Kapler and her husband, Gabe Kapler, decided to end their fourteen-year marriage in 2013. Based on the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">report published</a> on burchillfamilylaw.com, the divorce was done amicably and on agreed-upon terms.</p><p>According to the report, the divorce petition was submitted by Gabe Kapler to the Los Angeles County Superior Court. He decided to represent himself in the divorce process, which is unexpected considering he made millions of dollars during his playing career. He reportedly completed the paperwork himself and admitted to a reporter that he made a few errors.</p><p>Some of the errors he admitted to were requesting that his former name be restored, which was his wife’s maiden name, Jansen. Likewise, the request for spousal support, or maintenance, as it is known in Colorado, was also indicated.</p><p>Gabe Kapler must have had enough knowledge of the asset division in a divorce case for him to have represented himself in court. Be that as it may, the couple went through their divorce process amicably. They are currently granted access to co-parent their two children. Gabe once stated after the divorce that Lisa remains his best friend, and together they will continuously give their children the best.</p><h3><strong>Why Did Lisa Kapler and Gabe Kapler Divorce?</strong></h3><p>Although the couple refused to state the reasons why they decided to walk away from their marriage, there are different claims on the reason. Shortly after their divorce, it was speculated that Gabe Lisa’s ex-husband is gay. His sexuality was questioned when he decided to speak out for LGBTQ+ rights in one of his tweets on Twitter.</p><p>He made use of his other social media platforms to spread support for the LGBTQ+ community. Also, his silence over the speculation has convinced some of his fans that there may be an atom of truth in it. However, we’ll wait until he decides to openly confirm or deny it before arriving at any decision.</p><p>Since they called it quits, Lisa and Gabe have kept details of their relationship off the radar. Based on this, it is not known if they have moved on to other relationships or not.</p><h2><strong>Meet Gabe Kapler’s Children Who He Had With </strong><strong>Lisa Jansen</strong></h2><p>The American ex-professional baseball outfielder and his ex-wife welcomed two children during their marriage. Although some people might be expecting to see then choose a career after their father, it seems they are not as interested in baseball. Here are all to know about their children.</p><h3><strong>Chase Ty Kapler</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>October 8, 1999</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>24 years old</li></ul><p>Chase Ty Kapler is the first child welcomed by Gabe Kapler and his ex-wife, Lisa Jansen, during their fourteen-year marriage. He was born on October 8, 1999, in Tarzana, California, in the United States. Based on the reports available, he was born a few months before Gabe Kapler and his ex-wife, Lisa Jansen, got married to each other.</p><p>He was raised in the same city where he was born and hopefully received his elementary education there as well. Chase Ty Kapler obtained his high school education at Malibu High School in Santa Monica, California. According to reports, he is currently enrolled at the University of California, Riverside, California, where he is studying computer science.</p><p>Chase Ty Kapler, like his father, has picked up an interest in sports but is likely not interested in baseball like his father. During high school, Chase played on the Malibu High School football team as the team’s quarterback. Presently, it is unknown if he is still interested in football or plays for any team, as it looks like he is more focused on obtaining his university degree.</p><h3><strong>Dane Rio Kapler</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>November 3, 2001</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>22 years old</li></ul><p><span>Dane Rio Kapler is the second child and the second son of the couple. He was born on the 3rd of November 2001 in Tarzana, California, United States, two years after his parents’ marriage. Just like his brother, he was also raised in Tarzana.&nbsp;</span></p><p>He had his high school education at Ventura High School, which is located in Ventura, California, United States. Afterward, he moved to Canada where he got enrolled at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.</p><p>Dane, like his father and his brother, is also interested in sports, but he chose to take up another sport different from his father’s. He decided to go join his brother in playing, football. The 22-year-old son of Gabe Kapler now plays football for the University of British Columbia football team. Hopefully, he will make a career in football just like his father did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC4yKyYZqORpbmmvoywmKxln6OwpnnGmpmeZZuWva2x0axksKGWmnquscStZKGho2KwqbXLnamepl8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-benjamin-van-leer-lieke-martens-partner-relationship-timeline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Benjamin van Leer?
