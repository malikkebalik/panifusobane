communicated to the inexperienced pilot as the cause of the crash that left such a tragic mark on music history.</p><p>“It is believed that shortly after takeoff, pilot Peterson entered an area of

for aircraft attitude and orientation,” wrote the Civil Aeronautics Board charged with investigating the crash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tough bus rides on the Winter Dance Party tour, musicians

Mr. Dwyer said that when he accompanied pilot Peterson to ATCS (Air Traffic Control Service), no information was given to them indicating instrument flying weather would be encountered along the route.”</p><p>Peters was only certified for Visual Flight Rules, or clear weather, not Instrument Flight Rules, flying in&nbsp;clouds.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

class=credit>Fox Weather</span></figure><p>He passed the written exam for instrument flying but failed the practical flight check nine months before the crash.</p><p>He logged 52 hours of instrument training, all taken with a conventional artificial horizon instrument, a gyro horizon.</p><p>The gyro horizon, now called an attitude indicator, shows the pilot if he is flying parallel to the earth, up or down.</p><p>The indicator in the ill-fated Beechcraft Bonanza was a different type of indicator, an attitude gyro.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter

the conventional artificial horizon,” according to the accident report.</p><p>The report pointed out that ATCS was responsible for giving the pilot all available information and to interpret the data if requested.</p><p>“At Mason City, at the time of takeoff, the barometer was falling, the ceiling and visibility were lowering, light snow had begun to fall, and the surface winds and winds aloft were so high one could reasonably have expected to encounter adverse weather during the estimated two-hour flight,” the report continued.</p><p>The Analysis section of the accident report painted a tragic picture.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The report pointed out that ATCS was responsible for giving the pilot all available information and to interpret the data if requested. <span class=credit>Fox Weather</span></figure><p>“There is evidence that the weather briefing consisted solely of the reading of current weather at en route

could readily lead the pilot to underestimate the severity of the weather situation.”</p><p>The air traffic controller and Dwyer watched the plane take off around 1 in the morning.</p><p>Dwyer told

snow.</p><p>Parts littered 540 feet of the remote field and the main wreckage lay against a barbed wire fence.</p><p>The pilot was found in the plane, but the three musicians were thrown clear.</p><p>Investigators found evidence that the plane was set up for cruising and flying at an appropriate high speed, 165-170 mph.</p><p>But, the plane was actually descending at 3,000 feet per

rolled for 570 feet before the fence stopped it.</p><p>“The shape of the mass of wreckage approximated a ball with one wing sticking up diagonally from one side,” said the coroner’s report.</p><p>Analysis pointed out that high gusty winds and&nbsp;turbulence&nbsp;would have caused the rate of climb and turn instruments to fluctuate “to such an extent that an interpretation of these instruments so far as attitude control would have been difficult to a pilot as inexperienced as Peterson.”</p><p>“He could have become confused and thought that he was making a climbing turn when in reality he was making a descending turn,” the report concluded.</p><p>The coroner said that parts of each body had been frozen over the 10 hours of exposure at about 18 degrees.</p><p>The tour manager had to tentatively identify each body by clothing.</p><p>Maria Elena Holly told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Australian Financial Review</a>, 60 years after the crash, that she learned about it on TV.</p><p>The shock caused her to miscarry her baby with her husband of 6-months. She missed the funeral.</p><p>She was supposed to attend the tour but canceled when she found out she was pregnant, said the review.</p><p>She said she was terrified of small planes and that he would never have taken the flight if she had been with him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaWtfo7K4v46er6mdoqnAbr7Er5yapF2staLAjJyYrquVmXqjwcOdsGagn6G5ur%2BMqaOappViwbB5wquYrKBda4JuxcSaqaxlkZy8bsDOnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./guillermina-quinones-de-muniz-passes-away-hollywood-life.html>&#171;&nbsp;Guillermina Quinones De Muniz Passes Away Hollywood Life</a>
