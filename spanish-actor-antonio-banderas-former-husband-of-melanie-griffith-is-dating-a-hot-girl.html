Also, they were also spotted vacationing in St.Tropez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/15/AntoNicole-1571133370504.jpg><p>The lovebirds attended the UK premiere screening of Banderas' critically successful movie, <i>Pain and Glory</i>.
