While on the date, the two locked lips outside of Miss Lily’s, a Jamaican restaurant in the East Village, the outlet reported. An onlooker even told the outlet that “They were quietly sat away from everyone else at restaurant. It was clear they were into each other and sat close together throughout the meal. They left together and walked, stopping for long embraces and on the second kiss with hugs.” As of this writing, neither of them have publicly confirmed their relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>While on the romantic dinner date, Dua rocked a more casual look than her usual colorful outfits. She was seen wearing a black plunge top paired with blue jeans and leather jacket. Trevor also opted for comfort with a green utility jacket, black trousers, and Nike sneakers. Before they parted ways, Trevor and Dua gave each other a tight embrace and went in for a hot and heavy kiss.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Trevor is a comedian and actor most known for hosting the hit Comedy Central show The Daily Show.

Over the course of their relationship, the couple slowly became more comfortable showing off their affection for one another in the public eye. They attended events together, been photographed on vacations, and even <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared snapshots</a> from their romance on social media! Luckily, Dua’s ex wasn’t unfamiliar with the amount of scrutiny on their relationship, as Anwar comes from a high-profile family, himself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The Hadid family is full of models as well as American media personalities. Anwar’s mom, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong></a>, is a past cast member on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</a>, while his two sisters, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gigi</strong> </a>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a>, are models in their own right. So, how did Dua and Anwar’s paths cross? During the summer of 2019, Anwar and Dua seemingly bonded over music following their splits from their respective exes. In June of that year, the two reportedly went out on a date.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The pair’s romance quickly intensified as the two spent even more time together. In July 2019, they were spotted snuggling up at the British Summer Time Hyde Park music festival in London.&nbsp;In September 2019, Dua attended the funeral of Anwar’s grandmother in the Netherlands with the entire Hadid family, proving just how much their relationship had grown over the course of just a few months. However, by Dec. 2021, Dua and Anwar had officially <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> after over two years together.</p><h2>Dua Lipa’s Past Relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dua-Lipa-dating-history-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Although Anwar is undoubtedly Dua’s most high-profile romance thus far, it’s not her first. Prior to hooking up with Anwar, Dua dated model and chef <strong>Isaac Carew</strong> for nearly five years. The two were on-again, off-again from 2015 till their final split in 2019. They were often spotted out and about together, but also attended some major industry events. The former couple was photographed at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the May 2019 Met Gala</a> prior to their split just weeks later.
