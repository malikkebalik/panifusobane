There have been players who have exceeded expectations quite delightfully, whether it’s <a class=ath_autolink data-id=43 href=#>Houston Texans</a> quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OiILdmCU0Ie4L8vg href=#>C.J. Stroud</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=47 href=#>Miami Dolphins</a> running back <a class=ath_autolink data-id=PS8eSycQR4WDFnPl href=#>Raheem Mostert</a> or <a class=ath_autolink data-id=59 href=#>Los Angeles Rams</a> wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=YHrpPTuhsg1ZqXkt href=#>Puka Nacua</a>. The fantasy managers who used late picks or waiver claims to grab those values have feasted on delicious fantasy points all season long.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But for every C.J. Stroud there has been a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MHPQIoyRCSO0fiiE href=#>Joe Burrow</a>, who rounded into the form we expected just in time to suffer a season-ending wrist injury. For every Mostert there has been a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=onjc9SERD33ngDBE href=#>Miles Sanders</a>, who we just won’t talk about. For every Nacua there has been a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=q0QPlrY9858wcFnP href=#>Jahan Dotson</a>, who not even my “drop an NFC East guy and he’ll go off” superpower could make more than a so-so WR3 last week.</p><p>The closer we get to the fantasy postseason, the more important it is to trim the fat from your fantasy roster — to get the leftovers out of the fridge before you wind up with fantasy salmonella. To rid your roster of oyster stuffing before it ruins dinner altogether.</p><p>Oysters…do…not…belong…in…stuffing. Just leave them in the ocean where they belong.</p><p>So, like that uncle we all have who drinks half a bottle of wine before the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=41 href=#>Lions</a> game starts and then wants to talk (slur) politics, it’s time for these players to go.</p><p>(<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rostered Percentages Courtesy of Yahoo</a>)</p><h3><strong>Darrell Henderson, RB. Los Angeles Rams (51 Percent – Droppable in 12-Team Leagues)</strong></h3><p>Henderson was a fun story while it lasted — a player who went from watching football on TV just like us to joining the Rams midseason to posting double-digit PPR points three times in four games. Back when Henderson was re-elevated to the active roster, head coach Sean McVay lauded how quickly Henderson was able to reacclimate to being not just in the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> but on the field.</p><p>“Darrell came back in,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">McVay said</a>, “He’s done a great job of being able to quickly re-acclimate himself back to a lot of the things that we’ve done, he’s taken good care of himself in the meantime.”</p><p>Well, the party’s over. Yes, Henderson was able to score a short-yardage touchdown last week and catch four passes for 28 yards. But he carried the ball six times and gained one yard, which is a robust average of six inches (no, really) per carry. He was out-touched by <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cRNPE0KlZQvW5XJD href=#>Royce Freeman</a> 17-10. And most importantly, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=V9WsxIeYj24OGcsU href=#>Kyren Williams</a> is fully expected to return from injured reserve this week.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=IYn7GkEINqUslRyH href=#>Chuba Hubbard</a>, RB, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=35 href=#>Carolina Panthers</a> (63 Percent – Droppable in 12-Team Leagues)</strong></h3><p>Want to know how it feels to slowly have the will to live drained from your body one Sunday at a time? To yearn desperately for the days when you tried to make <a class=ath_autolink data-id=znOb6BnXeLfSyHa7 href=#>Carson Wentz</a> a functional NFL quarterback? Listen to Frank Reich’s post-game pressers in Carolina, where he talks about the process and the long-term and Oh God when will the losing stop it won’t ever stop.</p><p>“Not getting the results you want is frustrating,” Reich <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> after Carolina was drilled by the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Dallas Cowboys</a> in Week 11. “So, I’m frustrated most of all for (our coaches and players), but I’m frustrated for our fans as well. … You want change to happen overnight, but sometimes it takes longer than you want. But you have to keep your head down and be strong-willed and keep your vision every day and be able to fight your way through the tough times.”</p><p>My guy needs a hug.</p><p>I long ago advised cutting Miles Sanders who may have, earlier, been my single worst fantasy recommendation of 2023. But unless you are absolutely desperate for six points a week from an RB spot, the time has come to cut bait on Hubbard, too. Sanders and Hubbard are splitting touches almost right down the middle, and the Panthers are 29th in the league in rushing at 92.3 yards per game. Just get out — before you wind up like poor Frank.</p><h3><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=ULpvk1KL29cIpeSm href=#>Aaron Jones</a>, RB, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=42 href=#>Green Bay Packers</a> (98 Percent – Droppable (Maybe) in Shallow 12-Team Leagues)</strong></h3><p>OK, before everyone goes scrambling off to the comments to accuse me of sniffing glue, hear me out. I’m well aware that Jones appears to have at least dodged an ACL tear after Sunday’s scary-looking injury — the 28-year-old himself admitted to reporters that he feared the worst when he was originally carted off the field.</p><p>“If it was my ACL, then I’m done for the season,” Jones&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">said postgame, via The Athletic</a>. “I put in a lot of work and time in here with these guys, it felt like ‘man, I can’t catch a break,’ but I caught a break. I hope it’s not anything serious, and I’ll be back here.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>However, as of the time I’m writing this, we don’t know the results of the MRI on Jones’ knee. If it’s a significant MCL injury, then Jones could easily wind up on injured reserve, which would mean that he couldn’t return until Week 16 at least. At that point you’d be getting back a rusty ball-carrier who was 35th in PPR points and 26th in points per game over the first 10 weeks of the season.</p><p>You really want to roll that guy out in the semis? If it’s projected to just be a week or two absence, that’s one thing. But that’s not what I expect to hear — and this late in the game we might as well just face the fact that “Mr. Jones and Me” ain’t happenin’ this season.</p><h3><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=TbtHrFRp7Lrr9gRR href=#>Tee Higgins</a>, WR, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=37 href=#>Cincinnati Bengals</a> (93 Percent – Droppable in Shallow 12-Team Leagues)</strong></h3><p>Might as well really give the folks in the comments something to chew on. And no, I haven’t been hitting the wine. More of a beer fella.</p><p>We’re all still working through the five stages of grief to one extent or another about Burrow’s season-ending wrist injury, which is the capper to what has been a truly miserable contract year for Higgins. The Bengals are still in denial — or more appropriately, as backup quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=VZOoAKGo3lSqqeMc href=#>Jake Browning</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>, delusion.</p><p>“I’m not gonna hide the fact that I’m excited for my opportunity,” Browning said. “I think everybody in here, including Joe, kind of knows that. I’ve got a lot of confidence in myself. I think I’m borderline delusional when it comes to optimism.”</p><p>At least he’s honest.</p><p>Now, things could be worse — the Bengals could be starting <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ppfYs4UKzV66qcLD href=#>Tim Boyle</a> (pour one out for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MVKA2Tjc5jrKX2Eo href=#>Garrett Wilson</a>). But Higgins has a hamstring injury of his own that leaves his status for Sunday’s game with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=55 href=#>Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in doubt. And from what we saw of Browning against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=33 href=#>Ravens</a> last week he is, um, not Joe Burrow.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>I’m not dropping <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ToHiDqo1AnUHYTWK href=#>Ja’Marr Chase</a>, because, well, that’s kooky talk. But a banged-up No. 2 wideout playing with a backup quarterback the rest of the way? Given their respective situations, I’d drop Higgins for Odell Beckham right now without a second thought.</p><h3><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=zDqikSUJpSdjzoC1 href=#>Rashee Rice</a>, WR, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> (71 Percent – Droppable in 12-Team Leagues)</strong></h3><p>From just about the moment that Rashee Rice was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs, the fantasy community has been waiting for him to break out. And, well, we’re still waiting. However, despite a quiet first year, wide receivers coach <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Connor Embree told reporters</a> that the team has been pleased with the progress they have seen from the former SMU standout.</p><p>“Rice is coming along throughout the season,” Embree said. “I like where he’s at. He’s working well and working hard every day. Then the snap count, it just depends. We got seven to eight receivers, so it’s kind of whoever has the hot hand, we’ll keep feeding. Then it’s a next man up mentality and stay ready.”</p><p>I love how he says “seven or eight receivers” like any of them have been good this year. If they had, the Chiefs might have beaten <a class=ath_autolink data-id=54 href=#>Philadelphia</a> in Week 11 instead of scoring zero points after halftime in a game where <a class=ath_autolink data-id=tuwppBp0RpCzZ4az href=#>Justin Watson</a> was targeted 11 times.</p><p>Justin. Watson.</p><p>Here’s the cold, hard truth. As great as <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WWwiw0IQD5ozgrHf href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a> is, the only wide receiver in Kansas City who fantasy managers can trust in a must-win game is none of them. Rice has topped 60 yards in a game once as a rookie, and in a lot of leagues there are more reliable options with lower rostered percentages only because they don’t play with Mahomes.</p><p>Just stay the hell away from Tim Boyle—and that infernal oyster stuffing.</p><p>Gary Davenport wishes you all and your families a safe and Happy Thanksgiving.
