So, he used the first 2 letters of his father’s name ‘Vi’, ‘K’ from Kennedy, first 2 letters from his mother’s name ‘Ra’ and ‘ram’ from his zodiac sign Aries and composed his name as Vikram.</li><li>The actor has promoted various social causes. In 2011, he appeared as the Youth Envoy for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. Chiyaan also has his welfare association called The Vikram Foundation and was also linked with Kasi Eye Care providing support to the underprivileged.</li><li>During his college days, the actor met with an accident while returning home on his motorbike after receiving the best actor award at IIT Madras. He suffered a serious leg injury and was hospital-ridden for 3 years. He has undergone 23 surgeries to prevent his leg from being removed surgically. Since he was able to walk only using crutches, he obtained permission from the management to finish his study at home and completed his final year of college studies.</li><li>For the film I (2012), Vikram portrayed the roles of a bodybuilder, a model, a beast and a hunchback. To portray the role of a bodybuilder, he put on weight by sticking to a protein-rich diet and coffee to make his muscles look distinct on screen. For the role of a model, he lost weight. Later, he lost 56 kilos of weight and shaved his head to portray the role of a hunchback. During his massive weight reduction process, he ate small meals of egg whites instead of regular food intakes. It took nearly 3 years to complete the production for the film. The actor has said that he suffered from folliculitis due to prosthetic make-up he had to wear for the film.</li><li>In July 2022, Vikram was admitted to Kauvery Hospital in Chennai after he complained of discomfort in the chest due to high fever symptoms. It was later revealed that he did not have a cardiac arrest and was clinically stable.</li><p>Featured Image by U.S. Consulate General Chennai / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Flickr</a> / Public Domain</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2BgpKqRonqir9OoqWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-jay-cutler-s-wife-kristin-cavallari-age-instagram-and-more-the-talks-today.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Jay Cutlers wife, Kristin Cavallari?
