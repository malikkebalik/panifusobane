Delve into His Blissful Married Life</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Tony Goldwyn'</strong>s acting career dates back to the 80s, but the actor's rise to mainstream is relatively recent. Goldwyn's acting prowess was reckoned when he played Carl Bruner in the fantasy thriller film, <i>Ghost</i>, in 1990. The 90s and the early aughts saw Goldwyn proving his flair in various genres, but he got his overdue recognition, playing Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III in the ABC tv series, <i>Scandal.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Since kicking off his career in the mid-80s, Goldwyn branched his repertoire into various fields. Besides being an acclaimed actor, he is also a producer, singer, director, and political activist. Throughout his stellar career, Tony has attracted minimal attention in his personal life, perhaps because the actor's life away from the spotlight is remarkably ordinary. &nbsp;</p><h2>Dive into Tony Goldwyn's Enduring Marriage! &nbsp;</h2><p>Tony Goldwyn is nothing like his fan-favorite character, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III, in<i> Scandal</i>. The ABC show which ran from 2012 to 2018, shows Tony's character indulging in an affair with<strong> Kerry Washington</strong>'s character, Olivia Pope. In reality, Goldwyn's life is anything but an emulation of his reel life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/3/144373788_274038024149489_1693572290660783135_n%20(1)-1704295544639.jpg><p>The SAG-nominated actor is a royalty himself. Born to late actress <strong>Jennifer Howard</strong>, and her second husband, film producer <strong>Samuel Goldwyn Jr.</strong>, Goldwyn's successful personal life proves that one's personal trajectory doesn't necessarily mirror their parents'. Both of Tony's parents married three people in their lifetime. &nbsp;</p><p>He has been married to his wife, <strong>Jane Musky,</strong> for over three decades. The duo met via a mutual friend and got married in 1987. The couple might not be a recurring figure on red carpets or pop into headlines, but fans best believe that the two are going strong. &nbsp;</p><p>"A guys' night out for me is...being with my wife! Since I'm at work a lot, I want to be with her when I'm home," the <i>From Earth to the Moon</i> actor said in a rare interview. While reflecting on his two+ decades with Musky, Goldwyn once divulged all that he had learned to keep a marriage working. &nbsp;</p><p>For the <i>Divergent</i> actor and his wife, "Communication" is everything. "It's too easy to make assumptions about the people we're with all the time — what they're thinking or feeling — without actually talking,"<a href=#> said </a>Goldwyn, who shared three kids with Musky. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>More About Tony Goldwyn's Wife, Jane Musky!&nbsp;</h2><p>Aside from being a doting wife to Goldwyn and supporting him through thick and thin, Musky has also been navigating a demanding career in Hollywood. Unlike her husband's profession, that puts him in glaring spotlight every now and then, Musky's work requires little to no public accountability. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/3/116811884_198701571608980_8266670225330907050_n%20(1)-1704295553921.jpg><p>For the past few decades, Tony's wife has been working as a production designer. One can gauge Musky's unparallel flair by skimming through the number of movies that she has worked on. Jane has designed sets for blockbusters like<i> When Harry Met Sally, Ghost, Seagulls</i>, and <i>Hustlers.</i></p><p>Also, an art director, Musky's work received prestigious acclaim when she earned an Emmy nomination for designing the 90s CBS show, <i>School Break Special.</i> She met her award-winning husband in her 20s and although, many might not be aware of it, but Jane played a crucial role in Tony's formative career. &nbsp;</p><h3>Tony Goldwyn and Jane Musky are Parents to two Daughter!&nbsp;</h3><p>Throughout their blissful conjugal life, Tony and Musky have collaborated on various projects but the two consider their daughters, <strong>Anna Musky-Goldwyn</strong>, and <strong>Tess Goldwyn</strong>, their greatest accomplishments. Both Goldwyn girls, raised away from the spotlight, have turned out to be as low-profile as their parents. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/3/29090121_211107812990958_7757989230512439296_n%20(1)-1704295560351.jpg><p>"My best accomplishment is the time I've put into our two daughters," Goldwyn said. The <i>Ghost</i> actor is beyond proud of his girls, both of whom are following in their parents' footsteps. While their oldest, Anna, 27, is a screenwriter, and fitness enthusiast, their youngest, Tess, is hustling as an actress, and writer in the industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Anna's IMDb shows that she has so far worked in <i>Supergirl, The Labyrinth, Dilated,</i> and<i> Greener.</i> The oldest Goldwyn, who will turn 28 this May, is the co-founder of Political Playlist, a millennial and Gen-Z targeted site established to inspire youngsters to connect with the government. &nbsp;</p><p>Anna is gearing up for the most important day of her life as she recently announced her engagement with her long-time boyfriend, <strong>Billy Durden</strong>, a film editor. Judging from Anna's post, the two started dating five years ago, and <a href=#>got engaged</a> in November 2023. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHq1u82yZKCnnJnEurqMsKCfnV2Zsq3CxGagp6yfYrWqv4ybo6Kro5vCrXnMmqmroZWZeq21xZ4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./andrew-wiggins-siblings-the-basketball-legacy-of-a-family.html>&#171;&nbsp;Andrew Wiggins Siblings: The Basketball Legacy of a Family</a>
