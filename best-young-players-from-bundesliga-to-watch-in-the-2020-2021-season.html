class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During the 2019/20 Bundesliga season, there were more than a few youngsters that caught the eye of everyone.&nbsp;Here, we list four of the best young performers this season that you should definitely follow next season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Alphonso Davies, Left Back</h2><p>Alphonso Davies is a 19-year-old Canadian left-back who plays for German league champions Bayern Munich. He joined Bayern in January of 2019 and has been playing for the first team ever since. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>From the start of the 2019/20 season, Davies <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has been a starter</a> in the Bayern team, whether it be in the left-back position, on the left midfield, on the left-wing, or on the right-wing. But mostly, he played as a left-back and made the position his own. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>If we talk about the league alone, Davies played in 29 Bundesliga matches and started 24 of them. He gathered 2,234 minutes on the pitch and contributed three goals and five assists in the league alone.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In terms of stats, his pace, dribbling, and passing abilities impressed both fans and critics. He could run past players with ease. This, along with his body feints and close control, allowed him to have great dribbling stats. He completed 90 of his 145 attempted dribbles this season and dribbled past 98 players in the league. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As for his passing, his progressive passing and his long passing stats also stand out. He made 191 progressive passes and completed 76.9% of his 260 attempted long passes. Along with this, he made 103 key passes, 103 passes into the final third, 37 passes into the penalty area, and 19 crosses into the penalty area.</p><p>Along with his offensive numbers, he also earned&nbsp;good defensive numbers at the rate of1.98 successful tackles per 90, 1.37 interceptions per 90, and 2.18 clearances per 90. And he had zero errors leading to a goal despite spending most of the time in the opposition half as an attack-minded full-back with a dribbling tenacity.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>At just 19, he has a lot of room to improve, and he will be a player to keep an eye for the next season, especially in the Bundesliga. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Erling Haland, Striker</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Erling Braut Haland is only 20 years old, but he is regarded as one of the most prolific strikers in world football right now.&nbsp;He has everything that a good center forward needs; pace, strength, and heading abilities.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Norwegian striker had an amazing 2019/20 season with both RB Salzburg in Austria and Borussia Dortmund in Germany.</p><p>First, let’s talk about the first part of his 2019/20 season with RB Salzburg in Austria. In 14 matches that he played in the Austrian Bundesliga, he scored 16 goals and provided four assists. He managed to achieve those <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">numbers </a>in 980 minutes at the rate of 1.47 goals per 90. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His stellar performance at RB Salzburg made Borussia Dortmund purchase him in the middle of the season. On January 1, 2020, he joined Dortmund&nbsp;for a fee of just €20 million and gave his new team&nbsp;exactly what they wanted and expected him to provide — goals.</p><p>Haland celebrated his German Bundesliga debut with a hat-trick against FC Augsburg. Including his debut, he played 15 matches for Dortmund in the league. In total, he&nbsp;scored 13 goals and provided three assists. He did so in 1,063 minutes at the rate of 1.10 goals per 90.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Moussa Diaby, Left Winger</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Moussa Diaby arrived at Bayer Leverkusen from Paris Saint-Germain at the start of the 2019/20 season for a fee of just €15 million. And even though he already had a competition on the flanks from Leon Bailey and Paulinho, he managed to become the first-choice winger for manager Peter Bosz.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He played 28 matches for Leverkusen during the 2019/20 Bundesliga season, among which 18 were starts. And in the 1,771 minutes that he spent on the pitch, he had a decent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">output</a>.</p><p>A left-footed winger, Diaby bagged five goals and provided the same number of assists. He was played in both the right and left-wing. But, he mostly played on the left-wing, and his primary job was to pass and cross the ball into the penalty area and make long passes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stats from FBref</a>, his passing was decent in the 2019-2020 season.

He makes this list of exciting young players both because of his impressive performances this season as well as for the potential future that he holds during the next one.

In total, he was able to get 1,146 minutes on the pitch and scored four goals and five assists, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to Transfermarkt</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreso, he was involved in 1.84 shot-creating actions per 90 and 0.44 goal-creating actions per 90.
