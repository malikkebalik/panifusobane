Iglesias was born on 15 July 1976 in San Diego, California USA of Mexican descent. He is a comedian, film and television producer, actor, screenwriter and director. He is perhaps best recognised for his comedy show “I’m Not Fat…I’m Fluffy”.</p><p>So how rich is Gabriel Iglesias? Sources estimate his current net worth to be $15 million and it seems to be increasing with each year. Most of it has been accumulated from his movie “The Fluffy Movie”, and his work as a voice actor in “El Americano: The Movie”, “The Book of Life” and others, during a career which began in the late 1990s.</p><h3>Gabriel Iglesias Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Gabriel Iglesias lived in Long Beach for most of his formative years. After matriculating, he started his career as a comedian while still working at a ‘phone company. He decided that comedy was something that he wanted to do in his life as a full-time job, and so quit his regular job, despite his relatives advising against it. His first appearance on television was in 2000 in the Nickelodeon TV comedy series “All That”, in which he played a variety of characters during his first year, and which established his net worth.</p><p>Then In 2006 he was one of the contestants in the reality television show “Last Comic Standing”, managing to progress as one of the eight comedians participating, although later disqualified. In 2011, “Comedy Central” released Gabriel’s stand-up comedy series entitled “Gabriel Iglesias Presents Stand Up Revolution”, which received positive reviews from the public and comedy enthusiasts, so adding considerably to his net worth.</p><p>Gabriel’s work as a voice actor became an important part of his career too, and so boosted his net worth. In 2008 he voiced a group of characters in the popular animated series “Family Guy”, and he also became the voice of several characters in another animated series – “The High Fructose Adventures of the Annoying Orange” in 2012 – which was a show that was first known as a YouTube web series “The Annoying Orange”.</p><p>While this is probably not related to his involvement in a previously mentioned series, in 2012 he was also invited to guest star in an episode of the popular YouTube series “Epic Meal Time”, and has also been featured in another popular YouTube series, “Equals Three”, several times. Gabriel is also known for working as a voice actor in feature movies –&nbsp; he became the voice of Ned and Zed in Walt Disney Pictures animated movie “Planes” in 2013, and the following year he voiced the character Jimmy in the animated comedy “The Nut Job”. In the same year, he also voiced the character Pepe Rodriguez in the animated musical comedy “The Book of Life”, and Garcia in another animated movie, “El Americano”, in 2015. Currently, he is working on a comedy drama film “Magic Mike XXL”&nbsp; released in 2017, all of which added steadily to his net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Gabriel Iglesias is known for having struggled with health problems because of being overweight, at one time 445 lbs/200 kgs, and contracted Type 2 diabetes which threatened his life. However, he seems to have managed to get into a healthier lifestyle, and now continues to talk about his weight as one of the topics of his comedy shows. He apparently lives with his girlfriend Claudia Valdez in San Diego, and they share a son from her previous relationship. In 2012, he received the Beacon of H.O.P.E. Award for his charitable efforts, involvement and continuous support with the organisation.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=30.927480916031><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gabriel Iglesias</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 15, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Diego, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Comedian, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Voice Actor, Television producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Esther Pinuelas Mendez, Jesus Iglesias</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Claudia Valdez</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Gabriel J.
