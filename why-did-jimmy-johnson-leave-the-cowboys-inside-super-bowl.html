Despite the team’s success, the constant bickering and disagreements took a toll on their working relationship, leading to Johnson’s decision to part ways with the Cowboys.</p><p>It is worth noting that while the exact details of the conflicts may not be fully known, the impact of these disagreements was significant enough to result in Johnson’s departure from the team.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jimmy_Johnsons_Coaching_Career_with_the_Dallas_Cowboys></span>Jimmy Johnson’s Coaching Career with the Dallas Cowboys<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Turning_the_Cowboys_Fortunes_Around></span>Turning the Cowboys’ Fortunes Around<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jimmy Johnson’s coaching career with the Dallas Cowboys from 1989 to 1993 marked a turning point for the franchise.
